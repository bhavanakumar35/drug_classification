Drug Classification:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify drugs based on patient data. The dataset contains various features such as age, gender, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratios, which are used to predict the type of drug a patient should be prescribed. 

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning algorithms to classify drugs based on patient characteristics. We start by preprocessing the data, including handling categorical variables, missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the features. Afterward, we train multiple machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The models are evaluated based on accuracy and other performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project, `drug200.csv`, contains 200 records of patients with features such as:
- Age: The age of the patient.
- Sex: Gender of the patient.
- BP: Blood pressure levels (High, Normal, Low).
- Cholesterol: Cholesterol levels (High, Normal).
- Na_to_K: Sodium-to-Potassium ratio in the blood.
- Drug: The type of drug that should be prescribed (Drug A, Drug B, etc.).

Approach:
1. Data Preprocessing: 
   - Encoding categorical variables like `Sex`, `BP`, and `Cholesterol` using `LabelEncoder`.
   - Checking for and addressing any missing data.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
   - Visualizing the distribution of drugs among the patient population.
   - Identifying correlations between patient features and drug types.
3. Model Training: 
   - Implementing several classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
4. Model Evaluation:
   - Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to solve classification problems in the medical domain. By experimenting with various models, we provide insights into how different patient characteristics can be used to predict the correct drug prescription. The project can be expanded to include more complex models, cross-validation, and tuning of hyperparameters to further improve accuracy
